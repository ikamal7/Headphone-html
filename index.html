						<p>The trend is clear; more and more people are walking around with wireless headphones. Some of
							the best selling headphones in our country are from Apple, which have an exorbitant price.
							The cost of Air Pods is beyond many budgets and there are many of us who are simply not
							willing to pay that amount for a pair of earbuds.</p>
						<img src="image/advbanner2.jpg" alt="advbanner2" />

						<h2>Why are wireless headphones so popular?</h2>
						<p>Wireless headphones have finally become a viable option. In previous years, the sound quality
							was much worse with bluetooth headphones than ones with cords. They would drain music player
							batteries and the sound wasn't even that great Nowadays, both of those problems are solved.
							Recent advances in Bluetooth technology have improved sound quality so much that the cord is
							no longer necessary for crisp and clear audio. Bluetooth still requires a deal of battery
							power, but longer battery lives of devices and the prevalence of portable chargers leave
							that concern in the past, too.</p>

							<p>Name brands have been all over the wireless earbud trend, but Bose, Apple and Candyskull
								charge a fortune. Is going wireless really worth the cost? For these companies, it is!
								Many news sources have reported that there have been so many Air Pods lost in the New
								York subway lines that the public transport workers now refuse to pick them up for
								travelers. <br /> <br />

								Since so many users end up dropping or losing their wireless earbuds, they've been
								making record profits on headphones! People love wireless earbuds so much that they've
								been purchasing replacements, even at the steep cost. However, not everyone has hundreds
								of dollars lying around to spend on earbuds. Are wireless headphones not worth is in the
								end? We recently discovered a brand that is overtaking the famous one in many countries.

						<h2>Earbuds That are Affordable for Everyone</h2>
						<div class="section_3_left">
							<p>The wireless earbuds sweeping sales across Europe are iHeadphones. The iHeadphones
								earbuds have an attractive design that is very similar to AirBuds. They even
								<strong>surpass the competition</strong> in many aspects. The most important thing is
								that the latest generation of iHeadphones are <strong>compatible with Android and
									iOS</strong>, something which previous versions were not. A lot of big brand tech
								companies are cartering their headphones to one operating system of the other, but
								iHeadphones are really for everyone. They have the clean and crisp audio that we crave
								on our commutes, but for a much better value. <br /> <br />

								Now, you don't have to decide between the affordability of headphones with cords and
								wireless earbuds. You can try out wireless headphones to see if they fit your lifestyle
								without having to invest a lot of money or get a new pair without wincing when you make
								the purchase. iHeadphones are earbuds that make your ears and your wallet happy.</p>
